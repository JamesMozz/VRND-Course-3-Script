# VRND-Course-3-Script
Script module within course 3

For this module, we had to animate a coconut by adding a Rigidbody (applying gravity) and a Sphere Collider 
(to stop it from passing through the ground). I then modified another coconut using a script in place of the 
Rigidbody and Sphere Collider which makes the second coconut hover up and down in a sin function movement. 

*To insert video of animation at a later date*
